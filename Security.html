    <h1>DATA SECURITY POLICY</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Here at RAXVA RCM, we collect, process and store personal data for a range of business purposes.
        Data subjects include customers, suppliers, partners, employees, clients and other stakeholders and individuals.
        Bearing in mind RAXVA RCM’s commitment to uphold the rights of the individual as enshrined in law, our data security policy is designed to protect all past, current and future employees, customers, or partners, from illegal or damaging activity conducted by others using their personal data.
        Our data security policy outlines how RAXVA RCM will endeavour to guard and protect all personal data.
        It also sets out to raise the awareness of staff members in relation to the ways in which GDPR impacts their use of individuals’ personal data.
        This policy applies to all data processing activities involving RAXVA RCM and includes activities or systems related to both internal business operations, as well as external relations and any third-party agreements.
        Please note that RAXVA RCM’s data security policy applies to all employees, and this policy may be subject to review and amendment on a regular basis.
        For more information about this policy and its overall implementation, consult our Data Protection Officer.
        This document is subject to regular review to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance.

    <h2>Data security policy definitions</h2>

    <h3>Personal data</h3>

    </ul>
    <p>
        The above list is by no means exhaustive, and should be used merely as a point of reference from which a working definition of personal data can be established and further developed.
    </p>

    <h3>Sensitive personal data</h3>

        Under GDPR, sensitive personal data is defined as encompassing any of the following:
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Purposes of personal data</h3>
    <p>
        RAXVA RCM uses personal data for a range of various purposes.
        These purposes may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial</li>
        <li>Administrative</li>
        <li>Human resources</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note the above list is by no means exhaustive, and should merely be used as a reference point from which a working definition of purpose can be established.
    </p>

    <h3>Business purposes</h3>
    <p>
        RAXVA RCM must carry out a range of functions and processes as part of our operational activity.
        Data kept in relation to these activities falls under the category of data for business purposes, which includes information of the following nature:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operational</li>
        <li>Compliance</li>
        <li>Policy adherence</li>
        <li>Human resources and personnel</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The above list is by no means exhaustive, and should be used merely as a point of reference from which a working definition of business purposes can be established and further developed.
    </p>

    <h2>Fair processing</h2>
    <p>
        At RAXVA RCM there will be occasions when employees will need to process personal data; however, processing activities must always be carried out in a fair and lawful manner that is compatible with the rights of each corresponding individual.
        Consequently, we should avoid processing the personal data of any individual who has not provided us with explicit consent.
        Our company must strive to obtain explicit consent at all costs, and we must clearly identify to the individual what data is being processed, why we need to use it and who will have access to their data.
        These factors must be identified and clearly reiterated to the individual at the point of request for consent.
        It’s worth noting there may be exceptional circumstances in which we are asked to process sensitive personal data without consent.
        An example of an exceptional circumstance could include legal obligations we may need to carry out to comply with health and safety regulations.
        RAXVA RCM endeavours to take all actions necessary to ensure that all personal data we obtain, process and store is accurate, relevant and adequate in relation to the reason in which we asked for that information.
        We should not hold excessive or irrelevant data on any individuals, and we will not process any personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose in which the relevant individual has consented to the processing of their data.
    </p>

    <h2>Our roles and responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        Data security is a critical component of our business.

        Please note that RAXVA RCM takes data protection incredibly seriously, and we expect all staff members to adhere to this data security policy.
        Any failure and refusal to comply with this policy could ultimately place our company at risk.

        In light of our commitments, it is mandatory all staff members must observe and adhere to the following data security policies:
    </p>

    <h3>Data storage policy</h3>

        <li>Employees must install and use software and systems that have been licensed and approved by the company on devices while carrying out the duties of their role.

    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that RAXVA RCM will carry out regular system audits to monitor and ensure ongoing compliance with this data security policy and all regulatory requirements as outlined under GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>Data retention policy</h3>
    <p>
        While RAXVA RCM must routinely collect and store data, we are committed to the rights of individuals.
        That’s why we retain all information and personal data for no longer than we need to.
        The necessary length of retention will often be decided on a case-for-case basis, bearing in mind the rationale and original purpose surrounding data collection and retention.
        Decisions of this nature must be made in a way that is compatible with our existing data retention guidelines under GDPR.
        For additional guidance, consult the following corresponding documents:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data retention and erasure policy document</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>International data transfer policy</h3>
    <p>
        Employees must observe a series of restrictions that apply towards the international transfer of data or personal information.
        Employees are not permitted to transfer personal information or data outside of the United Kingdom without having obtained explicit permission in the first instance from the company’s Data Protection Officer.
    </p>

    <h3>Data encryption and anonymisation policy</h3>
    <p>
        RAXVA RCM deploys encryption to secure and protect data that is stored on devices from unlawful processing or unauthorised access.
        Encryption is also used to protect information that is in transit.
        We also use the anonymisation of personal data wherever deemed prudent to ensure the rights of the individual are fully protected and observed.
        In line with these principles, we are committed to the use both encryption and anonymisation as a risk management tool alongside existing systems, to protect the company from accidental loss, as well as from the damage or destruction of data or personal information.
    </p>

    <h3>Activities that are prohibited</h3>
    <p>
        Unless otherwise noted or informed, employees are strictly forbidden from using company equipment, tools or systems for any purpose unrelated to their role responsibilities, excluding any previously mentioned exceptions.
        This policy also relates to any relevant systems, tools or equipment belonging to a company client or partner.
        Bearing that in mind, the following activities should be deemed forbidden with no exceptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any unauthorised replication of copyrighted materials.</li>
        <li>The violation of individual rights by way of the unnecessary collection, storage and processing of personal data or information.</li>
        <li>The violation of rights of an individual or organisation protected under intellectual property law in any jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>The use of any programme, command or interface designed to interfere with a user or corresponding user session.</li>
        <li>The accessing of any data, user account or server for any purpose unrelated to the business function of an individual’s company role.</li>
        <li>Issuing fraudulent product or service offers from a company account.</li>
        <li>The allowed sharing or use of employee login credentials or company systems by anyone apart from the named individual.</li>
        <li>The export of proprietary or confidential information as it relates to the company.</li>
        <li>The export of any software or data that is in breach of regulation or the company’s data security policy.</li>
        <li>Knowingly causing a network disruption or security breach.</li>
        <li>An employee is not allowed to access data that is not intended for them by logging into a system or gaining access to a confidential or limited-access account. The only exception to this rule is if the employee is granted access as part of a specific company project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that any violation of this policy can lead to disciplinary action, alongside legal action where deemed prudent or necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting security issues</h2>
    <p>
        If you encounter any incidents or issues relating to the security or protection of information or data, you must report this immediately to company management.
        Management will subsequently take and record any action deemed necessary to prevent damage or loss in relation to a security threat.
        If necessary, it is the responsibility of company management to report relevant incidents relating to a data breach or information security threat to regulators or the authorities.
        Under GDPR, it also falls upon management to contact the individuals involved in any breach or security threat.
