    <h1>Raxva RCM Security</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        Effective Date: February 6, 2026<br>
        Version: 1.0
    </div>

    <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span>Security Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        Raxva RCM Ltd ("Raxva") adopts a "Security First" architecture designed to meet the rigorous
        standards of the US Healthcare industry (HIPAA) and UK Data Protection laws (GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
        Our infrastructure is built to ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)
        of all Client Data.
    </p>

    <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span>Cloud Infrastructure &amp; Data Residency</h2>
    <p>Raxva does not maintain physical data centers. We leverage Microsoft Azure, a global leader in cloud security.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloud Provider:</strong> Microsoft Azure (HITRUST CSF Certified, SOC 2 Type II Compliant,
            and FedRAMP High Authorized).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Residency:</strong> To comply with US healthcare data sovereignty requirements,
            all production data and AI processing occur exclusively within the US East (Virginia) region.
            Data never leaves the US jurisdiction during processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network Isolation:</strong> We utilize Azure Virtual Networks (VNETs) and Private Links
            to isolate our application infrastructure from the public internet.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span>Encryption Standards</h2>
    <p>We enforce strict encryption protocols for data in all states.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between the Client, Raxva, and Payer
            systems is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher with strong cipher suites. We force HTTPS for all web traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data at Rest:</strong> All databases, object storage, and backups are encrypted
            using AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard). Key management is handled via Azure Key Vault.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">4.</span>AI Safety &amp; Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Raxva utilizes a "Transient Processing Model" for Voice AI to minimize risk exposure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Zero Retention Policy:</strong> Audio recordings of patient interactions are processed in real time
            and are not stored permanently on our servers after the transaction is resolved, unless explicitly required
            by the Client for audit trails.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Public Training:</strong> Raxva does not use Client PHI (Protected Health Information) to train
            public foundation models (such as public GPT-4). Our AI models run in a private, isolated container within
            our Azure tenant.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">5.</span>Access Control &amp; Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA is enforced for all Raxva administrative accounts
            and developer access points.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):</strong> Access to production data is restricted to a limited
            number of authorized personnel who require access to perform their job functions. Access rights are reviewed
            quarterly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Audit Logging:</strong> We maintain detailed logs of all system access and data processing activities
            via Azure Monitor to ensure full traceability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">6.</span>Application Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Secure Development:</strong> We follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines during our software development
            lifecycle (SDLC).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> We perform automated dependency scanning to identify and patch
            security vulnerabilities in our code libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> We conduct regular internal security reviews and architecture audits.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">7.</span>Incident Response</h2>
    <p>Raxva maintains a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Notification:</strong> In the event of a confirmed Data Breach affecting PHI, Raxva will notify
            the Client without undue delay and within 72 hours of discovery, in accordance with HIPAA Breach Notification
            Rule and UK GDPR requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> We are committed to full transparency regarding the nature and scope of any
            security incidents.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">8.</span>Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>HIPAA:</strong> Raxva acts as a Business Associate under HIPAA. We execute a Business Associate
            Agreement (BAA) with all covered entities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>GDPR:</strong> We comply with the UK Data Protection Act 2018.
        </li>
    </ul>
