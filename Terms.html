    <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a binding agreement between Raxva RCM Ltd ("Raxva," "we," "us")
        and the entity executing an Order Form or utilizing our Services ("Client," "you").
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>“Services”</strong> means the AI-driven Revenue Cycle Management automation platform, including
            Voice Agents, API integrations, and reporting dashboards provided by Raxva.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>“Client Data”</strong> means any data, content, or information provided by the Client to Raxva,
            including Patient Health Information (PHI).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span>License and Restrictions</h2>
    <p><strong>2.1 Grant of License.</strong> Subject to payment of fees, Raxva grants Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services for its internal business operations.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Restrictions (The "Anti-Copy" Clause).</strong> Client shall not, and shall not permit any third party to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Services.</li>
        <li>(b) Modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Services.</li>
        <li>(c) Use the Services to build a competitive product or service.</li>
        <li>(d) Use the Services for any illegal purpose or in violation of HIPAA/GDPR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1 Raxva IP.</strong> Raxva retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all software, IVR Navigation Databases, AI System Prompts, Voice Logic, and all improvements, enhancements, or modifications thereto.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2 Client Data.</strong> Client retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Client Data.</p>
    <p><strong>3.3 Aggregated Data.</strong> Client agrees that Raxva may collect, use, and disclose quantitative data derived from the use of the Services for industry analysis, benchmarking, and other business purposes.

    <h2><span class="section-number">4.</span>Data Privacy and HIPAA</h2>
    <p><strong>4.1 HIPAA Compliance.</strong> To the extent Raxva processes Protected Health Information (PHI) subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), such processing shall be governed by the Business Associate Agreement (BAA) attached to the Client Order Form. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the BAA, the BAA shall control regarding PHI.</p>

    <p><strong>5.1 Accuracy of Data.</strong> Client is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Client Data (including Patient IDs and Provider NPIs) provided to the AI Agents. Raxva is not liable for claim denials resulting from incorrect data provided by the Client.</p>
    <p><strong>5.2 Third-Party Credentials.</strong> To perform the Services, Client may provide Raxva with access credentials (usernames/passwords) for third-party systems (e.g., Practice Management Software, Payer Portals, Clearinghouses).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Raxva Responsibility:</strong> Raxva agrees to store these credentials using enterprise-grade encryption (Azure Key Vault) and use them solely for the purpose of executing the Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Responsibility:</strong> Client represents and warrants that it has the authority to grant Raxva access to these systems. Client is responsible for managing the lifecycle of these credentials (e.g., creating a specific "Bot User" account) and revoking Raxva’s access immediately upon termination of this Agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5.3 Authorization to Act.</strong> Client hereby appoints Raxva as its authorized agent for the limited purpose of contacting Insurance Payers and accessing Payer Portals to inquire about claim status on Client’s behalf.</p>

    <h2><span class="section-number">6.</span>Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." RAXVA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Specific Disclaimer:</strong> Raxva does not guarantee that the Services will be error-free or that the
        Insurance Payer (e.g., UHC, Aetna) will provide accurate information to the AI Agent. Raxva is not responsible
        for the outcome of any insurance claim.

    </p>
    <p>

        FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE.
    </p>
